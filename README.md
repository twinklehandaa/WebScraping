# Web Scraping
Web scraping is a useful technique for extracting data from websites. **Beautiful Soup** is a Python library that makes it easy to parse HTML and XML documents. Essentially, it takes a messy web page and turns it into a structured object that you can easily navigate and extract data from. We use it to sift through the HTML code of websites and find the specific information we need.
